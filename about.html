                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a dedicated **Full-Stack Developer** with a passion for clean architecture 
                    and problem-solving. While my introduction focuses on front-end skills, 
                    my journey involves bridging the gap between design and functionality across the 
                    entire stack. I've spent <b>half a year</b> building applications that are not 
                    just visually appealing but are also efficient, scalable, and maintainable.
                </p>

                <h3>My Journey & Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    My background in self-learning, and college provided me with a strong foundation in 
                    analytical thinking. I approach web development with a philosophy centered on 
                    user experience (UX), believing that the best technology is invisible to the user. 
                    I thrive on the iterative nature of development, constantly refactoring and improving 
                    code quality.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Contributing to Open Source:** I aim to contribute to a major open-source project by the end of the year.</li>
                    <li>**Certification:** Planning to achieve a certification in Google Cloud, and AWS Cloud Services.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, you can find me casually gaming, and or seeing the sights. 
                    I believe a balanced life fuels creativity in my development work.
